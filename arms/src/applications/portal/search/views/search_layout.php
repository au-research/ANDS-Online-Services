		<div class="excerpt">
			<p>Bacteria that cause infections are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. In Gram-negative bacteria much of this resistance is caused by mobile resistance genes. Our ability to monitor and predict the spread of resistance in these organisms largely depends on our ability to understand the genetic elements responsible for spread of these resistance genes. We have developed unique technologies that allow us to create an archive of relevant elements and to identify them in bacterial DNA sequences. The aim of this project is to make our knowledge repository of antibiotic resistance gene cassettes (an important mechanism for the spread of resistance) available to the wider research community and to allow researchers to annotate sequences containing gene cassettes using our system and contribute new entries to the repository as these are found. This system is an on-line application that allows microbiologists to: 1. browse and explore the gene cassette repository 2. annotate cassette array sequences using our knowledge base and the Attacca annotation engine 3. contribute new cassettes not yet in the database and obtain unique names for them.</p>

		<div class="excerpt">
			<p>Understanding the effects that humans have on the environment is becoming increasingly important as the world recognises the impact of global climate change and potential loss of biological diversity. It is becoming critical to provide scientists with the ability to rapidly and accurately collect and analyse data to assess ecological health. Acoustic sensing is an effective tool for monitoring species that have regular and predictable vocalisations, and offers an enduring record to allow for future interpretation of results.Environmental sound is a rich source of data. The sounds of a habitat are almost like a heartbeat, providing a general measure of its health. A pilot project using MQUTeR acoustic sensors is being run in the Samford Valley, on the outskirts of Brisbane. The project aims to monitor long-term climate change using an array of acoustic sensors.Sound is collected using an acoustic sensor network (which uploads data automatically), or via standalone recorders (users upload their data).**Grantor:**External Ref:</p>

		<div class="excerpt">
			<p>The omnium is a newly introduced track cycling competition to be included in the London 2012 Olympic Games. It involves six individual events and, therefore, requires strategic planning for riders and coaches to achieve the best overall standing in terms of the ranking, speed, and time in each individual component. The goal of the project was to identifiy winning performance patterns of riders in the omnium based on the performance results. The unsupervised, supervised, and statistical analyses have been conducted on the men’s and women’s historical competition data in the World Championships since 2008 to find winning patterns for each gender in terms of the ranking of riders in each individual event. The project was started in January 2010 and is ongoing</p>

		<div class="excerpt">
			<p>The total bridge maintenance expenditure for the year 2004-05 in Australia was AUD521M - a 27% increase from 2002-03. The efficient use of public funds for the well-being of bridge networks requires an effective Bridge Management System (BMS). Most bridge authorities collect inspection data but most of which is incompatible with BMS requirements - hence, they are unusable. This research is on the generation of usable historical data using Artificial Intelligence techniques to reliably predict future bridge deterioration. The outcome will help bridge authorities to effectively plan maintenance strategies for obtaining the maximum benefit with limited funds.</p>
