Tropical Australia accounts for 46% of the nation's landmass and despite its low and dispersed population base, is the source of more than 30% of the nation's exports, particularly from mining, oil and gas. Six per cent of Australians live in the tropics, including close to one-third of indigenous Australians.\n<br\/><br\/>\nIn an era of climate change, tropical issues are of growing global significance. Approximately one-half of the world's population lives in the tropics. With population growth double the world average, the tropics are under severe and growing pressure.\n<br\/><br\/>\nA high proportion of the world's biodiversity is located in the tropics, including up to 80% of animal and plant species and 92% of world's coral reefs. Population growth and urbanisation have led to biodiversity loss on a massive scale in many tropical countries, a process exacerbated by climate change. High population density and growth are similarly linked to poor health outcomes and to the emergence of new infectious diseases.\n<br\/><br\/>\n<h3>eResearch Support Showcase<\/h3>\nTo meet the needs of researchers, James Cook University has developed a <a href=\"http:\/\/tropicaldatahub.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tropical Data Hub<\/a> as an 'open' portal, with contributors from a variety of state, commonwealth and university research programs submitting data sets and other content in an open and collaborative way. As well as hosting and exposing data, a key functionality of the portal is data searching (including via GIS methods) across disparate data sets.\n\n<br\/>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;font-decoration:italics;\"><br\/>[Source: James Cook University, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jcu.edu.au\/research\/JCUPRD_025773.html\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.jcu.edu.au\/research\/JCUPRD_025773.html<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/eresearch.jcu.edu.au\/projects\/tropical-futures-a-tropical-data-hub\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/eresearch.jcu.edu.au\/projects\/tropical-futures-a-tropical-data-hub<\/a> ]<\/span>\n\n<br\/><br\/>\n<h3>Key Research Areas<\/h3>\n\n<div style=\"float:left;\">\n\t<ul class=\"circle\">\n\t\t<li>Tropical Ecosystems, Ecology, Biodiversity and Conservation<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Climate Change<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Industries and Economies in the Tropics<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Tropical Health, Medicine and Biosecurity<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Tropical Freshwater and Marine Sciences<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Coral Reef Science<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"float:right\">\n\t<br\/>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/services.ands.org.au\/img\/tropics\/tropical_data_hub.jpg\" title=\"Geographical extent of the Tropical Data Hub courtesy of James Cook University - visit http:\/\/eresearch.jcu.edu.au\/tdh\/\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t<img src=\"http:\/\/services.ands.org.au\/img\/tropics\/tropical_data_hub_tmb.jpg\" alt=\"Geographical extent of the Tropical Data Hub courtesy of James Cook University\" \/>\n\t<\/a>\n<\/div>","auto_boxes":[{"id":"collections","query":"fulltext:tropics -key:(\"http:\/\/esrc.unimelb.edu.au\/OHRM#E000849\") -data_source_key:(\"www.qfab.org\/qfab2\") class:(\"collection\")","heading":"Collections","record_limit":5},{"id":"groups","query":"-data_source_key:(\"www.qfab.org\/qfab2\") -data_source_key:(\"PUBLISH_MY_DATA\") class:(\"collection\") fulltext:tropics","query_facet":"group","heading":"Data Contributors","record_limit":5},{"id":"services","query":"class:(\"service\") (key:(\"fb5b093a-1ef1-453d-80fb-124ae1776e82\") OR key:(\"http:\/\/imosmest.aodn.org.au\/2009101401440ND\"))","heading":"Related Services","record_limit":5},{"id":"activities","query":"(key:(\"griffith.edu.au\/146e8bc57e955d5c908efc690fe3269c\") OR key:(\"jcu.edu.au\/tdh\/activity\/15549\"))","heading":"Related Activities","record_limit":5}],"manual_boxes":[{"heading":"Other Related Links","items":[{"url":"http:\/\/tropicaldatahub.org\/","title":"The Tropical Data Hub"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nerptropical.edu.au\/","title":"NERP Tropical Ecosystems Hub"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.gbrmpa.gov.au\/","title":"Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.rrrc.org.au\/","title":"Reef & Rainforest Research Centre"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.csiro.au\/Organisation-Structure\/Divisions\/Ecosystem-Sciences\/Tropical-Arid-Systems.aspx","title":"CSIRO Tropical and Arid Systems Research Program"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.ath.org.au\/","title":"Australian Tropical Herbarium"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.track.gov.au\/","title":"Tropical Rivers and Coastal Knowledge (TRaCK) hub"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.aims.gov.au\/docs\/data\/data.html","title":"AIMS Data Centre"}]}]}}
