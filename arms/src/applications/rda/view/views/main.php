		<h1>Adaptive sensor networks for observing and assessing environment and ecological systems: Monitoring the Samford Valley Environment</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="post">
		<p>Understanding the effects that humans have on the environment is becoming increasingly important as the world recognises the impact of global climate change and potential loss of biological diversity. It is becoming critical to provide scientists with the ability to rapidly and accurately collect and analyse data to assess ecological health. Acoustic sensing is an effective tool for monitoring species that have regular and predictable vocalisations, and offers an enduring record to allow for future interpretation of results.Environmental sound is a rich source of data. The sounds of a habitat are almost like a heartbeat, providing a general measure of its health. A pilot project using MQUTeR acoustic sensors is being run in the Samford Valley, on the outskirts of Brisbane. The project aims to monitor long-term climate change using an array of acoustic sensors.Sound is collected using an acoustic sensor network (which uploads data automatically), or via standalone recorders (users upload their data).**Grantor:**External Ref:</p>
