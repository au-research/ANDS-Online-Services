<h2>RIF-CS Java API 1.2.0</h2>

<p>The RIF-CS API is an API developed by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) to aid developers in the processing and assembly of RIF-CS Documents. It is currently in the early stages of development and enables developers to access the structures of an existing RIF-CS document for simpler processing. The model supported is a RIF-CS DOM and most RIF-CS elements are provided their own classes which essentially encapsulate commonly used w3c DOM API methods to provide convenience classes and methods for obtaining element content and attributes. This enables developers to think about a RIF-CS Document as a collection of objects rather than having to carry out repetitive XML API calls in a RIF-CS document context.</p>

<p>It is intended for this API to grow as further RIF-CS development is undertaken at The Australian National University (ANU).</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="http://ands.org.au/resource/techdocs.html#rifcs">RIF-CS documentation</a> for schema, guidelines and vocabularies which must be used in conjunction with this API.</p>
