<h2>Self Service <i>Cite My Data</i></h2>

<div id="create">
<h3>Create DOI</h3>
<ul>

	<li>Before you can mint a DOI you must agree to the
	terms and conditions of ANDS <i>Cite My Data</i> by checking the box
	marked 'I AGREE'. You will need to do this each time you mint a
	DOI. It is important to carefully read the terms and
	conditions before you check the box. Once you have checked the 'I
	AGREE' checkbox, clicking on 'Continue' will take you to the Create
	DOI screen.</li>

	<li>This screen allows you to create ('mint') a new DOI using ?????????.</li>
	
	<li>ANDS recommends that if you have not used this service before and
	are unfamiliar with the DOI system you should read the ANDS
	Awareness level Guides on <a class="external" href="http://www.ands.org.au/guides/identify-my-data-awareness.html"><i>Cite My Data</i></a> and 
	<a class="external" href="http://www.ands.org.au/guides/persistent-identifiers-awareness.html">Persistent Identifiers</a>.</li>

	<li>Your DOI ???.</li>
	</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="list">
<h3>List My DOIs</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This screen lists any DOIs that you have previously minted using <i>Cite My Data</i> self-service.</li>
	
	<li>Clicking on any Handle which appears on the list will take you to
	the View Identifier screen which will allow you to choose to edit the
	values associated with that Handle and to add additional values to that
	Handle. <b>Note that you cannot delete identifiers once they have been
	minted</b>.</li>
	
	<li>Note that if you update the first URL associated with your Handle
	it may take up to 30 minutes before the resolver link for your Handle
	resolves to the new URL.</li>
</ul>
