<h1>About Research Data Australia</h1>
<h2>A Window on the Australian Research Data Commons</h2>
<p>Research Data Australia is a mesh of searchable web pages describing (and where possible linking to) Australian research data collections. Research Data Australia is provided by the <a href="http://www.ands.org.au">Australian National Data Service (ANDS)</a>.</p>
<p>ANDS seeks to support public access to as much publicly funded research data as can be provided within the constraints of privacy, copyright and technology.</p>
<p>ANDS is supported by the Australian Government through the <a href="http://ncris.innovation.gov.au/">National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy Program</a> and the Education Investment Fund (EIF) Super Science Initiative.</p>
