<h3>Research Context</h3>

Australia is unique amongst developed countries in having a significant landmass in the tropics. Tropical Australia accounts for 46% of the nation's landmass and despite its low and dispersed population base, is the source of more than 30% of the nation's exports, particularly from mining, oil and gas. Six per cent of Australians live in the tropics, including close to one-third of indigenous Australians.
<br/><br/>
In an era of climate change, tropical issues are of growing global significance. Approximately one-half of the world's population lives in the tropics. With population growth double the world average, the tropics are under severe and growing pressure.
<br/><br/>
A high proportion of the world's biodiversity is located in the tropics, including up to 80% of animal and plant species and 92% of world's coral reefs. Population growth and urbanisation have led to biodiversity loss on a massive scale in many tropical countries, a process exacerbated by climate change. High population density and growth are similarly linked to poor health outcomes and to the emergence of new infectious diseases.

<h3>eResearch Support Showcase</h3>
To meet the needs of researchers, James Cook University has developed a <a href="http://tropicaldatahub.org/">Tropical Data Hub</a> as an 'open' portal, with contributors from a variety of state, commonwealth and university research programs submitting data sets and other content in an open and collaborative way. As well as hosting and exposing data, a key functionality of the portal is data searching (including via GIS methods) across disparate data sets.
