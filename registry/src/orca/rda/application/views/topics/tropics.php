<h3>Research Context</h3>
    
Australia is unique amongst developed countries in having a significant landmass in the tropics. Tropical Australia accounts for 46% of the nation's landmass and despite its low and dispersed population base, is the source of more than 30% of the nation's exports, particularly from mining, oil and gas. Six per cent of Australians live in the tropics, including close to one-third of indigenous Australians.
<br/><br/>
In an era of climate change, tropical issues are of growing global significance. Approximately one-half of the world's population lives in the tropics. With population growth double the world average, the tropics are under severe and growing pressure. 
<br/><br/>
A high proportion of the world's biodiversity is located in the tropics, including up to 80% of animal and plant species and 92% of world's coral reefs. Population growth and urbanisation have led to biodiversity loss on a massive scale in many tropical countries, a process exacerbated by climate change. High population density and growth are similarly linked to poor health outcomes and to the emergence of new infectious diseases.

<h3>eResearch Support Showcase</h3>
To meet the needs of researchers, James Cook University has developed a <a href="https://eresearch.jcu.edu.au/tdh/">Tropical Data Hub</a> as an 'open' portal, with contributors from a variety of state, commonwealth and university research programs submitting data sets and other content in an open and collaborative way. The portal is intended to complement existing data repositories and stores and be a banner under which a variety of state, commonwealth and university research programs with interests in the tropics can be concentrated. In addition the hub provides a data hosting capacity in order to host significant national and international data sets. As well as hosting and exposing data, a key functionality of the portal is data searching (including via GIS methods) across disparate data sets.
